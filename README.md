Easy and Modern HTML5 GIFs and Animations

## What

Drag and Drop a set of PNG files to create PNG and CSS3 based animations. Runs in the browser, no need to download anything!

## Why

GIFs are great for simple animations you can embed on a webpage. But the quality sucks and they have huge file sizes.

[GIFV and GYF](https://giphy.com/create/gifmaker) are awesome if you alredy have a video, but a lot of the time you want to create an animation from a bunch of keyframes you made in Photoshop, GIMP, Illistrator, or something similar.

With CSS3 Animations, you can easily create high quality and customizable animations you can use.
